# PushSocket
## What is this?
PushSocket is a simple Open-Sourced, Public pub/sub service (if you'd like to even call it that) inspired by SimpleSocket. SimpleSocket is a complex, Closed-Source, Private pub/sub service. This module was made for those who don't have access to it.

I wouldn't even call it a pub/sub service, I'm just calling it that cause there's no other word.
